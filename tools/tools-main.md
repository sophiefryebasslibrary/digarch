## Introduction
We focus on streamlined processes and carefully selecting digital preservation tools that create standardized packages per the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) information model. We are using the following software to process approximately 10,000 pieces of optical media. 

### [IROMLAB](https://github.com/KBNLresearch/iromlab)
Iromlab (Image and Rip Optical Media Like A Boss) provides a simple and straightforward way to save the content of offline optical media. 

### [DROID](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/manage-information/preserving-digital-records/droid/)
DROID is a software tool developed by The National Archives (UK) to perform automated batch identification of file formats.

### [Bagger](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagger)
The Bagger application was created for the U.S. Library of Congress as a tool to produce a package of data files according to the BagIt specification.

### [Fixity Pro](https://www.fixitypro.com/)
Fixity Pro provides simple automated monitoring and reporting on the data integrity of files stored on local computers, removable storage devices, and mounted network storage locations.
