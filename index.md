# About the Sophie Bass Frye Library at the Museum of History and Industry (MOHAI)

MOHAI's research library, known as the Sophie Frye Bass Library, preserves and provides access to historic photographs and manuscripts, maps, books, motion pictures, and printed ephemera. Its collections cover the Seattle metropolitan area, Washington State, and Alaska. Archival holdings include business and organization records, personal papers, and other historical documents. There is also a growing collection of more than 600 oral histories.

Within the past five years, digital preservation has been a strategic focus of the library, with multiple projects being completed that help center the importance of migration, maintenance, and stewardship.

## Digital Archives Projects
The library's digital archive work currently centers on migrating born-digital photographs stored on optical media into stable digital storage. Broader work centers around born-digital accessioning and processing workflows and building sustainable digital preservation practices that fit into the organization's strategic plan. 

Previous digital archives projects include an oral history line-item inventory (2019), a digital preservation assessment and plan (2019), and a born-digital object inventory (2024).
