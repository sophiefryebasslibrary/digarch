# Accessioning
The Sophie Bass Frye Library is developing formal accessioning workflows for digital content. Accessioning is defined as taking intellectual, legal, and physical custody of digital content, both digitized and born-digital. This will include inventorying the content, confirming the collection is completed, documenting fixity, and creating an initial record in Proficio for all new digital acquisitions.
