## Bagger
Bagger is a Library of Congress tool for bagging files into the BagIt specification structure. It is a graphical user interface
(GUI) designed by Library of Congress to be a user-friendly alternative to the command-line BagIt application. MOHAI utilizes Bagger to acquire and package born-digital content.

We utilize different Bagger profiles for acquisition and project-based work.
