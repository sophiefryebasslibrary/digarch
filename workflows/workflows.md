# Workflows
This section highlights workflows necessary for MOHAI's current digital preservation project with the Seattle Post Intelligencer Collection. The basic structure of this workflow is to transfer content from obsolete physical storage media to server-based storage, understand and ingest the transferred content, generate integrity information for all relevant content, package content with relevant metadata and other relevant file information, store content in a secured environment with clear parameters about who can read, write, and access the content, and perform regular fixity checks of the content.

## Transfer Content off of Optical Media
* Required: Nimbie Autoloader + IROMLAB
  
## File Format Identification
* Required: DROID

### Opening and Preparing DROID
* Open DROID by clicking DROID.bat using the digital archives workstation.
* Install any updates that may pop up on the opening screen to ensure you are working with the newest information.
* Go to Tools > Preferences.
* Under Profile Defaults, check Select Generate Hash for Each File using MD5.
* Under Signature Updates > Update Settings, select Every time DROID starts up.
* Click OK to save these settings.
