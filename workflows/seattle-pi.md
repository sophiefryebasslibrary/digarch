# Seattle Post-Intelligencer Collection
This page documents the steps for MOHAI's current digital preservation project with the Seattle Post-Intelligencer Collection. 

The basic structure of this workflow is to transfer content from obsolete physical storage media to server-based storage, understand and ingest the transferred content, generate integrity information for all relevant content, package content with relevant metadata and other relevant file information, store content in a secured environment with clear parameters about who can read, write, and access the content, and perform regular fixity checks of the content.
